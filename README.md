# Data Science Playground

This repository serves as a structured space where I document my learnings, experiments, and reflections in the field of Data Science.

The objective of this repository is to consolidate theoretical understanding and practical knowledge gained across various domains within Data Science, including but not limited to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Statistics, and core Python programming. This collection is intended both as a personal reference and a resource for others who may benefit from organized, hands-on examples and concise conceptual notes.

## Folder Structure

- `machine-learning/`: Contains notebooks and explanations related to foundational and advanced machine learning algorithms.
- `deep-learning/`: Includes deep learning concepts, neural network architectures, and experimental implementations.
- `statistics/`: Focuses on statistical methods and their application in data science.
- `python-snippets/`: Handy Python scripts and code samples relevant to data analysis and algorithmic thinking.
- `resources/`: Supplementary material such as reference sheets, links, and curated reading lists.

Each section will be updated incrementally as I progress in my learning journey.

# Web Data Collection

This module is dedicated to showcasing foundational and practical concepts in programmatic web data acquisition. It includes both conceptual explainers and hands-on examples for:

- **Web Crawling** using Scrapy: Demonstrates how to systematically discover and traverse web pages within a domain.
- **Web Scraping** using Selenium: Focuses on extracting structured information from web pages, including those rendered with JavaScript.
- **Working with APIs**: Covers how to interact with public APIs to retrieve and handle data in real time.

The project structure clearly separates theoretical explanations from working implementations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the data collection pipeline.

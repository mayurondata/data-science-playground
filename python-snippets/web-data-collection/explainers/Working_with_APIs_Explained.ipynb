    "# APIs for Web Data Collection and AI Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are structured ways for programs to communicate and exchange data. In web data collection and AI pipelines, APIs allow us to request specific information directly from a server — usually in JSON or XML format — without scraping or parsing web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "An API is like a menu at a restaurant. It tells you what information or actions you can request from a system. You (the client) send a request, and the system (the server) returns what you asked for — usually in a well-organized format like JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need to know how the kitchen works (the internal code or database). You just need to know what is available (API documentation) and how to ask for it (via API requests).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is HTTP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is the main method used to send and receive data on the web. APIs use HTTP to communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most API URLs start with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "https\\://\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure** — it ensures the data sent and received is encrypted and safe from tampering or spying.\n",
    "\n",
    "An HTTP message generally includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Method** — the action you want to perform:\n",
    "   - `GET` → retrieve data\n",
    "   - `POST` → send new data\n",
    "   - `PUT` → update existing data\n",
    "   - `DELETE` → remove data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **URL** — the location of the resource you want to interact with\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Headers** — extra information like content type or API key\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Body** — the data you are sending to the server (only for methods like POST and PUT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (not an actual command):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "GET [https://api.example.com/users/7](https://api.example.com/users/7)\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "This means: \"Fetch the data about user 7 from the API.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is an HTTP Client?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **HTTP client** is a program or tool that can send HTTP requests and receive responses from a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple explanation:  \n",
    "If the API is a restaurant menu, the HTTP client is the waiter — it takes your order (request) and brings back your food (response).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common HTTP Clients:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Your browser** — sends GET requests to websites\n",
    "- **Python libraries**:\n",
    "  - `requests` — easy to use for most basic API work\n",
    "  - `httpx` — more modern and supports async operations\n",
    "- **Command-line tools**:\n",
    "  - `curl` — sends HTTP requests via the terminal\n",
    "- **Graphical tools**:\n",
    "  - `Postman` — a GUI tool to test, explore, and document APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Making a GET Request in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "response = requests.get(\"https://api.github.com/users/mayurondata\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(response.status_code)  # Shows the response status (e.g., 200 OK)\n",
    "print(response.json())       # Prints the returned data as a Python dictionary\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using curl to Make GET Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl https://api.github.com/users/mayurondata\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This sends an HTTP GET request to GitHub's API and prints the response (likely in JSON format).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making a POST Request – Explanation and Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is POST?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **POST** request is used when you want to **send data** to a server.\n",
    "* This is common when submitting a form, uploading something, or creating a new resource (like a user or post).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: POST Request Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "url = \"https://api.example.com/users\"\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Mayuresh\",\n",
    "    \"email\": \"mayu@example.com\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "response = requests.post(url, json=data)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(response.status_code)  # e.g., 201 Created\n",
    "print(response.json())       # The server's response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: POST Request Using curl\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -X POST https://api.example.com/users \\\n",
    "     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n",
    "     -d '{\"name\": \"Mayuresh\", \"email\": \"mayu@example.com\"}'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `-X POST`: explicitly tells curl to make a POST request\n",
    "* `-H`: adds a header (`Content-Type: application/json`)\n",
    "* `-d`: the data to send in the body of the request\n",

    "## RESTful APIs – Explained Simply\n",
    "\n",
    "A **RESTful API** follows a design pattern that makes APIs consistent and easy to understand. REST stands for **REpresentational State Transfer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### REST principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each piece of data has its own URL (called a **resource**)\n",
    "* You use standard HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) to interact with resources\n",
    "* The server does not store information about previous requests (it is **stateless**)\n",
    "* Data is usually returned in structured formats like JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: REST API Endpoints\n",
    "\n",

    "| Update a user       | `/users/7` | PUT    |\n",
    "| Delete a user       | `/users/7` | DELETE |\n",

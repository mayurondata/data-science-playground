# Python Snippets

This directory is a personal collection of Python code snippets, structured by topic to support learning, revision, and interview preparation. It aims to offer a compact reference of key Python concepts, from fundamentals to advanced techniques.

Each folder in this directory represents a major area of the Python programming language. While not every subtopic has a dedicated script or notebook, the goal is to capture practical examples and reusable patterns that represent the essence of each topic.

## Topics Covered

- **Advanced Python**

  - Generators and iterators
  - Context managers
  - Metaclasses
  - `functools` utilities like `lru_cache`, `partial`, etc.

- **Exceptions**

  - try-except-else-finally usage
  - Raising and handling exceptions
  - Custom exception classes
  - Common exception patterns and best practices

- **File Handling**

  - Reading and writing text files
  - Working with CSV and JSON formats
  - File modes and exception safety

- **Functions and Decorators**

  - Function definition and usage
  - \*args and \*\*kwargs
  - Lambda functions and functional utilities: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
  - Closures and scope behavior
  - Writing decorators (basic, with arguments, and chained)

- **Interview Programs**

  - Pattern printing (stars, numbers, pyramids)
  - String manipulation techniques
  - Prime check, palindrome, Fibonacci, etc.
  - List, dictionary, and recursion-based problems
  - Logic-based coding questions often seen in interviews

- **Modules and Packages**

  - Creating and importing Python modules
  - Structuring code into packages
  - Various import techniques and when to use them

- **Object-Oriented Programming**

  - Classes and objects
  - Inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel)
  - Polymorphism and encapsulation
  - Dunder methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, etc.)

- **Testing and Debugging**

  - Writing tests using `unittest` and `pytest`
  - Using assertions
  - Logging and basic debugging practices

- **Web Data Collection**
  - Web crawling using Scrapy
  - Web scraping using Selenium
  - Accessing and handling data from public APIs
  - Differentiating between static and dynamic content extraction
  - Structuring data collection pipelines for reuse and scalability

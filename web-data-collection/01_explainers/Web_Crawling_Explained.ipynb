    "# Web Crawling\n",
    "\n",
    "Web crawling is the process where a program (called a web crawler or spider) automatically visits websites and follows links to discover more pages. This helps build a list of URLs that might contain information we need, either from the entire internet or a specific section of a site.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Pure Web Crawling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure web crawling returns a set of discovered URLs that are likely to contain relevant information — based on link structures, URL patterns, and navigation paths — without extracting any actual content from the pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rationale: How Pure Crawlers Identify Relevant URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure crawlers don't access or analyze full page content. Instead, they infer which pages might be relevant by relying on structural clues like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **URL patterns** (e.g., `/product/`, `/catalogue/` often indicate detail pages)  \n",
    "- **HTML context** (e.g., links inside listing containers likely point to items)  \n",
    "- **Anchor text or attributes** (e.g., \"Logitech Keyboard\" in link text suggests relevance)\n",
    "\n",
    "These heuristics let crawlers intelligently guess page relevance and build a list of target URLs — all without actually opening and scraping the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Use Case: Crawling for Keyboards\n",
    "\n",
    "A valid crawling task could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Create a pure crawler that visits a predefined list of e-commerce websites and collects product URLs that likely correspond to keyboards. This is done by following category pages and inferring product relevance based on heuristics like URL paths, link text, or DOM structure — without extracting any product data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic case of targeted web crawling — where the focus is on discovery, not extraction.\n"
